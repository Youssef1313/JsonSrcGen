# JsonSGen
Json library that uses .NET 5 c# Source Generators

Note: Requires the .Net 5 Preview to run. Mono platforms do not have support for the .Net 5 Source Generators yet.

# Supported Types

**Classes**
Class serializers can be generated by defining a Json attribute on the class
```
[Json]
public class MyType
{
    [JsonName("my_name")]
    public string MyProperty {get;set}
}
```
Properties with the following types are supported
| int | byte | boolean | List<T> |
| int? | byte? | boolean? | |
| uint | long | string | |
| uint? | long? | DateTime | |
| ushort | float | DateTime? | |
| ushort? | float? | Guid | |
| short | double | Guid? | |
| short? | double? | Arrays | |

**Arrays**
Arrays are generated by defining a JsonArray attribute at the assembly level.

```[assembly: JsonArray(typeof(bool))] ```

**List**
Arrays are generated by defining a JsonList attribute at the assembly level.

```[assembly: JsonList(typeof(bool))] ```
